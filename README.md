# Data-Structures

This repository contains programs written in Python for various data structures. I worked with Abstract Data Types, Dynamic Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees and Graphs, Binary Search Trees, Hash Tables, Storage Management, Complexity Analysis of Data Structures.

Tests are included at the end of each program. Tests that I was not able to pass are: BST Remove, AVL Tree Add, AVL Tree Remove, SA Queue Dequeue, and OA Hash Map Resize Table.
